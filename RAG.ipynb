A significance test of a correlation coefficient allows us to assess whether the relationship between two random variables is the result of chance. Lesson 1 covers a parametric and a non-parametric approach to testing the correlation between two variables. If we decide that the relationship does not result from chance, then we can use this information in modeling or forecasting using regression models or machine learning covered in later Learning Modules.\\nWhen faced with categorical or discrete data, however, we cannot use the meth -\\nods discussed in the first lesson to test whether the classifications of such data are independent. If we want to test whether there is a relationship between categorical or discreet data, we can perform a test of independence using a nonparametric test \\nstatistic. The second lesson covers the use of contingency tables in implementing this \\nnon-parametric test.  \\nLEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW\\n ■There are three ways to formulate hypotheses.

One-sided alternative (left side): H0: θ ≥ θ0 versus Ha: θ < θ0\\nwhere θ0 is a hypothesized value of the population parameter and θ is \\nthe true value of the population parameter.\\n ■A parametric test is a hypothesis test concerning a population param -\\neter or a hypothesis test based on specific distributional assumptions. \\nIn contrast, a nonparametric test either is not concerned with a \\nparameter or makes mini  mal a ssumptions about the population from \\nwhich the sample comes.\\n ■A nonparametric test is primarily used when data do not meet distri -\\nbutional assumptions, when there are outliers, when data are given in ranks, or when the hypothesis we are addressing does not concern a parameter.\\n ■In tests concerning correlation, we use a t-statistic to test whether a \\npopula  tion c orrelation coefficient is different from zero. If we have n \\nobservations for two variables, this test statistic has a t-distribution \\nwith n − 2 degrees of freedom.\\n ■The Spearman rank correlation coefficient is calculated on the ranks of two variables within their respective samples.\\n ■A chi-square distributed test statistic is used to test for independence of two categorical variables. This nonparametric test compares actual frequencies with those expected on the basis of independence. This test statistic has degrees of freedom of ( r − 1)( c − 2), where r is the \\nnumber of categories for the first variable and c is the number of cate -\\ngories of the second variable.\\nTESTS CONCERNING CORRELATION\\nexplain parametric and nonparametric tests of the hypothesis that the population correlation coefficient equals zero, and determine whether the hypothesis is rejected at a given level of significance \\nThe most common hypotheses concerning correlation occur when comparing the population correlation coefficient with zero because we often ask whether a rela -\\ntionship exists, which implies a null of the correlation coefficient equal to zero (i.e., no relationship). Hypotheses concerning the population correlation coefficient may be two- or one-sided, as we have seen in other tests. Let ρ represent the population \\ncorrelation coefficient. The possible hypotheses are as follows:\\n Two sided: H0: ρ = 0 versus Ha: ρ ≠ 0\\n One sided (right side): H0: ρ ≤ 0 versus Ha: ρ > 0\\n One sided (left side): H0: ρ ≥ 0 versus Ha: ρ < 0\\nWe use the sample correlation to test these hypotheses on the population correlation.2\\n© CFA Institute.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'QUANTSmod9.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Tests Concerning Correlation 247\\nParametric Test of a Correlation\\nThe parametric pairwise correlation coefficient is often referred to as Pearson cor-\\nrelation, the bivariate correlation, or simply the correlation. Our focus is on the \\ntesting of the correlation and not the actual calculation of this statistic, but it helps \\ndistinguish this correlation from the nonparametric correlation if we look at the \\nformula for the sample correlation. Consider two variables, X and Y. The sample \\ncorrelation, rXY, is as follows:\\n   r  XY   =    s  XY   _  s  X    s  Y    ,  (1)\\nwhere sXY is the sample covariance between the X and Y variables, sX is the standard \\ndeviation of the X variable, and sY is the standard deviation of the Y variable. We often \\ndrop the subscript to represent the correlation as simply r.\\nTherefore, you can see from this formula that each observation is compared with \\nits respective variable mean and that, because of the covariance, it matters how much \\neach observation differs from its respective variable mean. Note that the covariance drives the sign of the correlation. \\nIf the two variables are normally distributed, we can test to determine whether \\nthe null hypothesis ( H\\n0: ρ = 0) should be rejected using the sample correlation, r. The \\nformula for the t-test is as follows:\\n  t =   r  √ _ n − 2   _ \\n √ _ 1 −  r   2     .  (2)\\nThis test statistic is t-distributed with n − 2 degrees of freedom. One practical obser -\\nvation concerning Equation 2  is that the magnitude of r needed to reject the null \\nhypothesis decreases as sample size n increases, for two reasons. First, as n increases, \\nthe number of degrees of freedom increases and the absolute value of the critical value \\nof the t-statistic decreases. Second, the absolute value of the numerator increases with \\nlarger n, resulting in a larger magnitude of the calculated t-statistic. For example, with \\nsample size n = 12, r = 0.35 results in a t-statistic of 1.182, which is not different from \\nzero at the 0.05 level ( tα/2 = ±2.228). With a sample size of n = 32, the same sample \\ncorrelation, r = 0.35, yields a t-statistic of 2.046, which is just significant at the 0.05 \\nlevel ( tα/2 = ±2.042).\\nAnother way to make this point is that when sampling from the same popula -\\ntion, a false null hypothesis is more likely to be rejected (i.e., the power of the test increases) as we increase the sample size, all else equal, because a higher number of observations increases the numerator of the test statistic. We show this in Exhibit 1  \\nfor three different sample correlation coefficients, with the corresponding calculated t-statistics and significance at the 5 percent level for a two-sided alternative hypoth -\\nesis. As the sample size increases, significance is more likely to be indicated, but the rate of achieving this significance depends on the sample correlation coefficient; the \\nhigher the sample correlation, the faster significance is achieved when increasing the \\nsample size. As the sample sizes increase as ever-larger datasets are examined, the null \\nhypothesis is almost always rejected and other tools of data analysis must be applied.\\n© CFA Institute.
